      My name is Joseph Armstrong and I'm 20 years old and a student at CSUF. I work part time and go to school for computer science and I plan on majoring in it. In my free time when I’m not at work or doing schoolwork I love editing videos and discovering new editing techniques. Other than that I love listening to music and going to concerts as well as playing games with my friends. I’m very hardworking and motivated and I feel unstoppable when I can get my head wrapped around something
